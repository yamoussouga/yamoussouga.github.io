To cite a quote from Google Search in MLA format, you can use the following format:
Author's Last Name, First Name. "Title of Web Page." Website Name, Day Month Year. URL. Accessed Day Month Year.1
For example, if you are citing a specific result from Google Search, you would format it as follows:
"Google Search. Google. 30 May 2013. Web. 26 May 2013. Accessed 26 May 2013." 
This format ensures that you provide all necessary information to accurately represent the source in your Works Cited page. 
Remember to adjust the date and URL according to the specific information you have for the citation.
