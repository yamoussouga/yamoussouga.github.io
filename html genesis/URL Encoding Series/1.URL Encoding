Here’s a complete breakdown of all character types in a URL according to the RFC 3986 standard, including which are allowed directly and which must be percent-encoded.

1. Unreserved Characters (Safe to use without encoding)
These characters can appear in a URL without encoding:
A–Z  a–z  0–9  -  _  .  ~
Letters: A-Z and a-z
Digits: 0-9
Hyphen: -
Underscore: _
Period: .
Tilde: ~

2. Reserved Characters (Have special meaning in URLs)
These are used for URL structure and must be encoded if used as data:
:  /  ?  #  [  ]  @
!  $  &  '  (  )  *  +  ,  ;  =

Categories:
General delimiters: : / ? # [ ] @
Sub-delimiters:     ! $ & ' ( ) * + , ; =

3. Percent-Encoding
Any character outside the unreserved set must be encoded as:
%HH
Where HH is the two-digit hexadecimal ASCII code.

Example:
Space → %20 (or + in query strings)
# → %23
? → %3F
4. Space Handling
In path: Must be %20
In query string: Often replaced with + (application/x-www-form-urlencoded) or %20
5. Non-ASCII Characters
Must be UTF-8 encoded first, then percent-encoded.
Example: é → UTF-8 bytes 0xC3 0xA9 → %C3%A9
6. Example URL Structure

scheme://user:pass@host:port/path?query#fragment
scheme: letters, digits, +, -, .
host: letters, digits, -, .
path/query/fragment: unreserved + reserved (encoded if needed)


Type	        Characters Allowed Directly
Unreserved	A-Z a-z 0-9 - _ . ~
Reserved	: / ? # [ ] @ ! $ & ' ( ) * + , ; =
Must Encode	Space, ", <, >, {}, `
If you want, I can give you a full ASCII table with URL-safe status so you can see exactly which characters are allowed, reserved, or must be encoded.
