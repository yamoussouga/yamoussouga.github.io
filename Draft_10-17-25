#Psalm 117, 121, 131
#James 1:5 
	"if anyone lacks wisdom, you should ask GOD, 
	 who gives generously to all without finding 
	 fault, and it will be given to you."
#Proverbs 2:6 
	"For the Lord gives wisdom; from his mouth 
	 come knowledge and understanding"
#Isaiah 41 verse 10
#Psalm 123
#614 -Like a Shepherd
#348 -Taste and See
#1Corinthians13, 2Corinthian s12
#Ephisian 2
#James 1:5
#1 Thessalonians 5:16-18
#Reveletion 3:8
#Esaia 40:31
#St Gianna patrone St of mothers, physicians and unborn children.
#Galatians 5:22-23, 
	"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, 
	 patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
	 gentleness, and self-control."
#Proverbs 16:32:
	"Better a patient person than a warrior, 
	 one with self-control than one who takes a city." 
#Proverbs 25:28:
	"Like a city whose walls are broken down is a man who lacks self-control." 
#Titus 2:6-8:
	"Likewise urge the younger men to be self-controlled, showing yourself in 
	all respects to be a model of good works, and in your teaching showing 
	integrity, dignity, and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that an
	opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us." 
#1Corinthians 9:27:
	"But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching
	to others I myself should be disqualified." 
#2Timothy 1:7 
	“For God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.”
	With the Holy Spirit inside of us, we are able to possess self-control 
	and demonstrate the fruits of the Spirit. As a result, we can live in a 
	way that is honorable to God.
#2 Corinthians 12:9—
	“My grace is all you need, for my power is the greatest when you are weak.” 
#Psalm 73:26—
	“My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my 
	portion forever." 
#Nehemiah 8:10—
	“Do not grieve, for the joy of the Lord is your strength.”
#John 17
