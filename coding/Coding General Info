Unicode is a comprehensive standard that assigns a unique number, known as a code point, to every character in almost all the world's writing systems. This standard ensures that characters from different languages can be represented consistently across different platforms and devices.
UTF-8 is one of the encoding schemes used to represent Unicode characters. It encodes each Unicode code point into a sequence of one to four 8-bit bytes. This encoding is efficient because it uses a single byte for ASCII characters (which are common in English text) and up to four bytes for other characters.
Key Differences
Nature: Unicode: A character set that maps characters to code points. UTF-8: An encoding scheme that converts these code points into a sequence of bytes.
Usage: Unicode: Defines the characters and their code points. UTF-8: Specifies how these code points are stored in memory or transmitted over networks.
Efficiency: UTF-8: More space-efficient for texts with many ASCII characters, as it uses only one byte for them. Non-ASCII characters use more bytes, but this is balanced by the common use of ASCII^2^.
Example
Consider the Chinese character "汉":
Unicode: The code point for "汉" is U+6C49.
UTF-8: This code point is encoded as three bytes: 11100110 10110001 10001001.
Practical Implications
Compatibility: UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII, making it a popular choice for web pages and network protocols.
Validation: UTF-8 can be easily validated, ensuring data integrity during transmission.
In summary,
while Unicode provides a universal set of characters, UTF-8 is a practical encoding scheme that efficiently represents these characters in a byte-oriented format.
