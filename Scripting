:)kwd[]
ASSOC | FIND .ext (displays only those file extensions which have the extension .ext)
#example:
&commat;echo off
assoc > C:\lists.txt
assoc | find .doc > C:\listsdoc.txt

<.ext>	Specifies the file name extension.
<filetype> Specifies the file type to associate with the specified file name extension.
/?	Displays help at the command prompt.

assoc [<.[ext]>[=[<filetype>]]]

To view the current file type association for the file name extension .txt, type:
assoc .txt

To remove the file type association for the file name extension .bak, type:
assoc .bak=
Make sure you add a space after the equal sign.

To view the output of assoc one screen at a time, type:
assoc | more

To send the output of assoc to the file assoc.txt, type:
assoc>assoc.txt

Associate .log to text files:
assoc .log=txtfile

Associate files with no extension to text files:
assoc .=txtfile

:)kwd[Batch file more]
In Windows Command Prompt (CMD), mathematical operations are primarily performed using the SET /A command. 
This command allows for arithmetic expressions and variable assignment within batch scripts or directly in the command line.
Arithmetic Operators:
Addition: + (e.g., SET /A result = 5 + 3)
Subtraction: - (e.g., SET /A result = 10 - 4)
Multiplication: * (e.g., SET /A result = 6 * 2)
Division: / (Integer division, e.g., SET /A result = 7 / 2 will result in 3)
Modulo: %% (Returns the remainder of a division, e.g., SET /A result = 7 %% 2 will result in 1. Note the double percentage 
sign %% when used in a batch file to escape the single % used for variable expansion.)
Bitwise Operators:
AND: &
OR: |
XOR: ^
Left Shift: <<
Right Shift: >>
Example Usage:
Code

@echo off
SET /A num1 = 15
SET /A num2 = 4

SET /A sum = num1 + num2
echo Sum: %sum%

SET /A difference = num1 - num2
echo Difference: %difference%

SET /A product = num1 * num2
echo Product: %product%

SET /A quotient = num1 / num2
echo Quotient (integer division): %quotient%

SET /A remainder = num1 %% num2
echo Remainder (modulo): %remainder%

:)kwd[string manipulation in Batch file]
#Create String
A string can be created in DOS in the following way.
SET v_str= get it together!
echo %v_str%

#Empty String
SET v_empty_str= 

#String Interpolation
String interpolation is a way to construct a new String value from a mix of constants, variables, literals, and expressions by including their values inside a string literal.
SET /A v_int = 7
SET v_str = get it done @
SET v_str1 = %v_str% %v_int% sharp!
echo %v_str1%

#String Concatenation
You can use the SET operator to concatenate two strings or a string and a character, or two characters. Following is a simple example which shows how to use string concatenation.

#String length
In DOS scripting, there is no length function defined for finding the length of a string. There are custom-defined functions which can be used for the same. Following is an example of a custom-defined function for seeing the length of a string.

#toInt
A variable which has been set as string using the set variable can be converted to an integer using the /A switch which is using the set variable. The following example shows how this can be accomplished.
#Align Right
This used to align text to the right, which is normally used to improve readability of number columns.
#Left String
This is used to extract characters from the beginning of a string.
#Mid String
This is used to extract a substring via the position of the characters in the string.
#Remove
The string substitution feature can also be used to remove a substring from another string.
#Remove Both Ends
This is used to remove the first and the last character of a string.
#Remove All Spaces
This is used to remove all spaces in a string via substitution.
#Replace a String
To replace a substring with another string use the string substitution feature.
#Right String
This is used to extract characters from the end of a string.
